# Yeoman generator for Dockerfile

## Installation

Make sure you have Node.js installed.

Install Yeoman and some tools globally (perhaps you need `sudo`):

```bash
$ npm install -g yo nsp jest-cli
```

## Use with Dockerfile uwegerdes/yeoman

If using from a Docker container be sure to have this generator in /home/node/src and the target directory in /home/node/app. The node_modules are in /home/node, more dependencies should be installed there.
